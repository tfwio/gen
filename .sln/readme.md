This note here is just for if you would like  to use Visual Studio Code.

Visual Studio Code: OmniSharp
==============================

So when in Visual Studio Code you can type (press F1 or Shift+Ctrl+P)

```text
> OmniSharp: Select Project
```

Select __generator.1.sln__ when presented with a list of Solutions.

This will set the main (featured) console application as the default
(or rather, selected) csproj context.
