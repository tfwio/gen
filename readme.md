**Generator** is a template driven code generation program written in csharp.

A command-line tool which uses a xml-based template and data-scheme
to generate code ready for reading and writing to a given database (such as SQLite).

Documentation on template authoring and data-scheme XML is to come...

*There is also (shoddy) UI for helping author such templates and data-schemes but the
licensing of its dependencies conflict, so no releases are provided.**
